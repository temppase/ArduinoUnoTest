# ArduinoUnoTest
## My first arduino project
---

My first Arduino project. In the beginning, I started working with only blinking light and prints to create a possible logic. When I got the actual motor driver circuit, I test the actual motor control.
---
The aim was to achieve interval movement and a return to zero points. The final application is intended to control the Arduino Duet and the x-axel motor.
---
Mainly, I followed the instructions in this link.

Some instructions on how to connect the motor had to be looked for on the manufacturer's and seller's websites. On the other hand, the code still needs to be changed when it is transferred to Duet.

Equipment used in the prototype:

- Arduino Uno
- A4988 driver
- Steppermotor 39BYGH 405B
- Switching plate

I try to add more details later.
